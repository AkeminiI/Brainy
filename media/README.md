# Media Folder

This folder contains photos, videos, and other visual assets documenting the Brainy autonomous rover project.

## Purpose
The media directory is used for:
- Build progress photos  
- Wiring and assembly images  
- Test videos from the rover  
- Diagrams and labeled pictures  
- Demonstrations for README and documentation  

## Subfolders (Recommended)
- **photos/** – images of hardware, wiring, and setup  
- **videos/** – test runs, demos, and project updates  

## Notes
Keeping media organized makes it easier for others to follow the project and helps with reports, documentation, and presentations.
