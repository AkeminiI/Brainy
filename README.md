# Brainy: Integrated Autonomous Rover System

Brainy is a tri-brain robotics platform combining:
- **Pixhawk** — the pilot  
- **Jetson Nano** — the intelligence  
- **Arduino Mega** — the senses  

Together they form a modular, intelligent autonomous rover capable of advanced AI navigation, sensor fusion, voice control, and multi-system coordination.

## 🚗 The Three-Brain Architecture

### **Jetson Nano (High-Level AI)**
- Runs neural networks  
- Handles speech recognition  
- Performs vision processing  
- Sends navigation commands to Pixhawk  

### **Pixhawk (Pilot / Motion Control)**
- Controls motors + steering  
- Executes autonomous modes  
- Maintains stability  
- Implements safety failsafes  

### **Arduino Mega (Sensor Hub)**
- Reads ultrasonic, IR, tilt, shock, rain, and light sensors  
- Provides microsecond timing  
- Relays data to Jetson + Pixhawk  
- Acts as the rover’s “sensory nervous system”
